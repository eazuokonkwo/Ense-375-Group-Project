## 1. Introduction

Accurate and consistent grade analysis plays an important role in academic systems, as it directly affects students’ academic standing and progression. Despite this importance, many educational environments still rely on basic spreadsheets or manual calculations to manage grades. These approaches are often time-consuming, inefficient, and more prone to errors. As courses become more complex and include a growing number of assessments, both students and instructors can struggle to keep track of grades clearly and accurately.

This project focuses on the design and development of a Student Grade Analyser that helps simplify and improve the process of managing and evaluating academic grades through automated calculations and validation. By applying core software engineering principles, the system is designed to produce reliable and accurate results while reducing human error. The project emphasizes the importance of building correct and dependable software, especially in systems that directly impact students’ academic outcomes.

The rest of this report is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the design problem and describes the system’s objectives, requirements, and constraints. Section 3 explains the design process and presents the final solution, with a focus on testing and validation. Sections 4 and 5 outline the team’s collaboration and project management approaches. Finally, Section 6 concludes the report and discusses limitations of the system along with possible future improvements.


## 2. Design Problem

### 2.1 Problem Definition

Managing grades can be a challenge for both students and instructors. Students often don’t know where they stand in a course until it’s too late. Instructors, on the other hand, spend a lot of time organizing marks, applying weights correctly, and checking for mistakes in spreadsheets. Even small errors can lead to misunderstandings or incorrect results.

Right now, there is no simple, easy-to-use tool that helps both sides clearly see and understand grade information. Students need a way to track their progress and explore what their final grade could look like, while instructors need a reliable system to calculate and review grades without constantly worrying about errors.

This project aims to address that gap by creating a Student Grade Analyser. The goal is to build a tool that can import grade data, calculate results automatically, and present the information in a clear and meaningful way.

### 2.2 Design Requirements

This section outlines the design requirements for the Student Grade Analyser, including the system’s functional requirements, objectives, and constraints. These requirements define the expected behavior of the system and provide a foundation for subsequent design, implementation, and testing activities.

#### 2.2.1 Functions

The Student Grade Analyser will:

1. Accept and import student grade data as input, including assessment names, marks obtained, and corresponding weight values.
2. Validate all input data to ensure that marks and weights fall within acceptable ranges.
3. Detect and report missing, invalid, or inconsistent grade entries.
4. Compute weighted course grades based on the provided grading scheme.
5. Calculate summary performance metrics, such as overall percentage and final letter grade where applicable.
6. Allow users to update or correct grade entries and automatically recompute results.
7. Display clear and interpretable output summarizing student performance.

#### 2.2.2 Objectives

The objectives of the Student Grade Analyser are to be:

- Accurate, so grades are calculated correctly.
- Reliable, giving the same results every time the same data is used.
- Easy to use, so students and instructors can use the system without confusion.
- Time-saving, reducing the need for manual calculations.
- Flexible, allowing different types of assessments and grading schemes.
- Clear, helping users understand how their final grade is calculated.
- Error-resistant, preventing common mistakes when entering grade data.

---

#### 2.2.3 Constraints

The design and implementation of the Student Grade Analyser are subject to the following design constraints, derived from economic, regulatory, reliability, ethical and societal considerations:

- The system shall be developed using only free and open-source tools and libraries, ensuring no financial cost to users or developers.
- The system shall restrict access to grade data to authorized users only and shall not expose student academic information to unauthorized parties.
- The system shall not store or transmit student data to external servers or third-party services.
- The system shall detect and report invalid or incomplete input data rather than producing incorrect grade calculations.
- The system shall perform grade calculations strictly according to defined grading rules and shall not alter results based on user identity or subjective criteria.
- The system shall present grade results transparently, allowing users to understand how final grades are computed.
- The system shall be designed to assist academic decision-making without replacing institutional authority or official grading processes.
