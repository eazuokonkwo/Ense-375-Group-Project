## 1. Introduction

Efficient and consistent grades analysis and evaluation is an important aspects in the academic systems. It directly affects the progression and academic standing of the students. And in many educational settings today, grade management is still handled using basic spreedsheets and or manual calculation and this is quite inefficient and more prone to errors. As course structures become more complex and assessment components increase, both students and instructors face challenges in maintaining clarity and accuracy in grade evaluation.

This project focuses on the design and development of a Student Grade Analyser intended to support the management and evaluation of academic grades through automated computation and validation. By leveraging established software engineering principles, the project emphasizes the importance of correctness, reliability, and systematic verification in academic software systems.

The remainder of this report is organized as follows. Section 2 defines the design problem and outlines the functional requirements, objectives, and constraints of the proposed system. Section 3 presents the iterative design solutions and the final selected design, with an emphasis on testing and validation. Sections 4 and 5 describe the team’s collaboration and project management approach, respectively. Finally, Section 6 concludes the report and discusses limitations and potential future enhancements.

## 2. Design Problem

### 2.1 Problem Definition

Managing grades can be a challenge for both students and instructors. Students often don’t know where they stand in a course until it’s too late. Instructors, on the other hand, spend a lot of time organizing marks, applying weights correctly, and checking for mistakes in spreadsheets. Even small errors can lead to misunderstandings or incorrect results.

Right now, there is no simple, easy-to-use tool that helps both sides clearly see and understand grade information. Students need a way to track their progress and explore what their final grade could look like, while instructors need a reliable system to calculate and review grades without constantly worrying about errors.

This project aims to address that gap by creating a Student Grade Analyser. The goal is to build a tool that can import grade data, calculate results automatically, and present the information in a clear and meaningful way.
